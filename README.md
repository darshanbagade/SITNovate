# Real-Time Sentiment Analysis for Customer Feedback

This project is a Streamlit-powered web application that enables users to analyze customer sentiments. Users can upload a CSV file containing customer reviews or fetch live discussions from Reddit. The application cleans and preprocesses the text, performs sentiment analysis using TextBlob, and provides interactive visualizations including sentiment distribution charts and word clouds.

- **Interactive Visualizations:**  
    - **Data Table:** Displays the processed reviews.

    - **Bar Chart:** Provides comparative sentiment counts.
    - **Word Cloud:** Highlights the most frequent terms in the reviews.

        python -m venv venv
        venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    On macOS/Linux:

## Configuration

The application uses environment variables to store Reddit API credentials. These are loaded from the `.env` file.

An example `.env` configuration:

```ini
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
REDDIT_USERNAME=your_username
REDDIT_PASSWORD=your_password
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=your_user_agent
```

Note: The `.env` file is gitignored (`.gitignore`) to prevent these secrets from being committed to the repository. For deployments (e.g., on Streamlit Cloud), add these secrets via the platformâ€™s Secrets Management.
